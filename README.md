# Momentum-Strategy
This Python script extensively analyses different financial assets, including stocks, commodities, and forex. 
The analysis is done from a momentum trading perspective, where it's believed that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to do so in the future. 
Conversely, stocks that have performed poorly in the past will continue to do poorly.

Then three assets are selected because they have the highest Sharpe ratio in their respective asset class. The assets r equally weighted in the portfolio.
The script conducts a comprehensive financial analysis of several different financial assets ('S&P500', 'ICESUGAR', 'USDJPY') based on a momentum strategy and consolidates them into a single portfolio. 
The momentum strategy is applied to the portfolio to get returns. We compare it with other benchmarks and do further analysis.

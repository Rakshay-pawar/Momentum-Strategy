# Momentum-Strategy
This Python script extensively analyses different financial assets, including stocks, commodities, and forex. 
The analysis is done from a momentum trading perspective, where it's believed that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to do so in the future. 
Conversely, stocks that have performed poorly in the past will continue to do poorly.

Then three assets are selected because they have the highest Sharpe ratio in their respective asset class. The assets r equally weighted in the portfolio.
The script conducts a comprehensive financial analysis of several different financial assets ('S&P500', 'ICESUGAR', 'USDJPY') based on a momentum strategy and consolidates them into a single portfolio. 
The momentum strategy is applied to the portfolio to get returns. We compare it with other benchmarks and do further analysis.

The strategy is based on the one in "A Century of Evidence on Trend-Following Investing" by Brian Hurst, Yao Hua Ooi, and Lasse Heje Pedersen 
Which does a sttudy of momentum strategy from1880 to 2016 on various asset classes. 
And because it ends in 2016, I conduct a similar strategy and analysis from 2016 to 2023
